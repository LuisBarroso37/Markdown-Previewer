# Markdown Previewer
Markdown Previewer Project - freeCodeCamp

In this project I made an editor where you can write anything in Markdown syntax and it immediatly shows the resulting HTML in a preview window.

Things I learnt:
- How to use React
- How to use marked.js library
- First contact with markdown syntax
- How to use variables in CSS

This page is built using React.
